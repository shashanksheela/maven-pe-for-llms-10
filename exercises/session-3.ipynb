    "Let’s say that we have the below set of bad and good user inputs. The inputs include the original task and user inputs. Your task is to build a system message prompt that can detect prompt injections when they appear in the user input. The input to your prompt would then be the entire task + input, such as “Classify the following text into positive or negative: ```The park seems very lively today and I having a great day.```”. Your detector should work with all the inputs below. You can also try creating harder examples for the detector to keep iterating and making your prompt more robust to diverse inputs. Apply best practices such as delimiters, clear instructions, CoT, or any of the methods we have discussed in the course. \n",

    "## Project 2: Build An Evaluation System with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we built a food chatbot that helped users find information about food items on a menu. We evaluated responses based on an eye test. However, as you aim to build a more reliable system you need to test and measure how robust your system is. One way to evaluate the reliability of a system is to use LLMs to evaluate output quality. Prompt engineering skills are essential for building powerful LLM-powered evaluation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, your task is to evaluate the output quality of your food chatbot based on a set of instructions you have defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to write a system message where you define an assistant that helps evaluate whether the responses sent by the chatbot are satisfactory and factual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your system should return “Yes” if the response the chatbot has sent is appropriately using the information in the food menu. It should return “No” if the food chatbot is not using the information correctly (e.g. if it’s returning information about a food item that doesn’t exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am providing the user input and chatbot response, along with the food menu, below so you can test your evaluation system to see if it’s doing the evaluation correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are designing an evaluation system, the user message will include the user question, chatbot response, and the entire food menu. You can design your user message however you see fit but always make sure to pay attention to how you are passing the information, the order, and the structure. Try to apply as many tips/tactics as possible that we have learned such as applying delimiters and so on. \n",
